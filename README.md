# Image Resizing using STB

This program resizes an image using the STB Image library. It loads an image, resizes it to half its original size, and saves the resized image as a JPEG file.

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- STB Image library (https://github.com/nothings/stb)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git

2. Compile the program:

   ```bash
    gcc -o resize_image resize_image.c -lm
   
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
    ./resize_image
   
  Make sure to replace "ENTER HERE ABSOLUTE PATH TO THE PICTURE" in the code with the absolute path to the input       image file you want to resize.
